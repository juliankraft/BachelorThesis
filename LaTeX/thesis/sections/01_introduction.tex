\section{Introduction}\todo{Its a starting point, needs to be extended and improved.}
\label{introduction}

The ongoing loss of biodiversity is among the most urgent environmental issues globally \autocite{brondizioGlobalAssessmentReport2019, cardinaleBiodiversityLossIts2012}.
Small mammals, despite their ecological importance, often receive limited attention in conservation research compared to birds and butterflies \autocite{grafWildlifeCampusKleineSaeugetiere2022}.
This disparity persists although small mammals significantly contribute to ecosystem functions such as seed dispersal and soil aeration.
In Switzerland, of the approximately 30 native small mammal species, several are endangered and require targeted conservation strategies \autocite{bafuListeNationalPrioritaren2019}.
In response to these challenges, the Wildlife@Campus project was initiated to establish a long-term and locally anchored monitoring program for small mammals in the urban context of the \ac{ZHAW} Campus WÃ¤denswil.
By combining citizen science with scientific research, the project aims to improve the detection and understanding of small mammal populations while also raising public awareness and contributing to species conservation efforts \autocite{grafWildlifeCampusKleineSaeugetiere2022}.

\subsection{Background}
Monitoring small mammal populations traditionally involves labor-intensive methods like live trapping, which not only consume significant time and resources but also pose risks to animal welfare \autocite{grafWildlifeCampusKleineSaeugetiere2022}.
Indirect, more efficient survey methodes are a very much needed alternative to monitor less invasive and to generate more data for less effort.
A proven to be effective method is the use of footprint tunnels showing a very low non detection rate \autocite{yarnellUsingOccupancyAnalysis2014}.
A further non-invasive method with increasing relevance is the use of \ac{eDNA} for species detection with high reliability \autocite{thomsenEnvironmentalDNAEmerging2015}.
The method in focus for this study utilizes camera traps for species detection --- an approach that has seen rapid and widespread adoption in ecological and conservation research \autocite{delisleNextGenerationCameraTrapping2021}.
Based on findings from the Wildlife@Campus project, a combined approach using camera traps for continuous monitoring and \acs{eDNA}-based methods for species-level identification appears to be a promising and scalable solution for small mammal detection in urban environments \autocite{grafWildlifeCampusKleineSaeugetiere2022}.
As part of the Wildlife@Campus project, initial efforts were made to explore the collection of non-invasive genetic material such as hair and fecal samples.
While these genetic methods were not fully implemented during the pilot phase, they were recognized as essential for identifying cryptic or morphologically similar species and are considered a key component of future monitoring strategies.
Based on the design of the \enquote{Mostela} camera trap box, \textcite{aegerterMonitoringKleinmustelidenSchlaefern2019} developed the \enquote{MammaliaBox}, adapting it to local conditions for monitoring small mustelids and dormice in Switzerland.
In addition to improving image quality, he conducted extensive field testing and produced a detailed guideline for standardized and effective deployment.
During the Wildlife@Campus pilot phase, images were generated exclusively using \enquote{MammaliaBoxes} at multiple locations on the ZHAW campus. 
These camera trap boxes produced a substantial volume of image material, capturing a wide range of small mammal activity.
Significant effort has already been invested within the Wildlife@Campus project to manually label a substantial portion of the image dataset and to explore automated approaches to species detection.
In fact, a preliminary solution for training a deep learning model was developed and tested, and a usable labeled dataset already exists \autocite{ratnaweeraWildlifeCampusProgressReports2021}.
However, this work remained largely undocumented and was not brought to full completion or operational integration. 
In the context of this bachelor's thesis, I revisit and build upon these foundations with the goal of refining, reproducing, and properly documenting a functional pipeline for automated image evaluation.

\subsection{Problem Statement}


\subsection{Related Work}

Deep learning methods, particularly \ac{CNN}, have revolutionized image classification tasks, showing significant promise for ecological monitoring.
The \ac{MD} \autocite{morrisEfficientPipelineCamera2025}, specifically developed for camera trap images, exemplifies successful application in biodiversity monitoring and provides a foundation for further optimization \autocite{hernandezPytorchWildlifeCollaborativeDeep2024, velezChoosingAppropriatePlatform2022, schneiderRecognitionEuropeanMammals2024}.
Studies such as those by \textcite{velezChoosingAppropriatePlatform2022,schneiderRecognitionEuropeanMammals2024} demonstrate robust detection performance but highlight limitations in species-level classification, particularly for morphologically similar species.

Integrating \ac{eDNA} techniques alongside automated image analysis, as explored by recent initiatives, can substantially enhance the accuracy of small mammal detection, providing a more comprehensive and reliable monitoring approach.

This thesis aims to advance these methodologies, contributing to more effective biodiversity conservation strategies.
