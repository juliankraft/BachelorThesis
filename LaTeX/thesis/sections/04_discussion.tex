\section{Discussion}
\label{discussion}

    \subsection{Detection}
    - some examples for very nice BBoxes and some bad ones

    - discussion of the snail problem

    \subsection{Model Performance}
    - discussing model performance

    - plot with train metrics for all models

    - highlighting the advantages of pretrained models

    \subsection{Best Model}
    - showing the best model and some analysis of its training

    \subsection{Limitations}

    The biggest limitation of the currant approach is the lack of a extra class for samples that do not fall into any of the available categories forcing the model to make a decision even if this is not reasonable.
    A very good example for this is the snail problem, where the model is forced to classify a snail as one of the available mammel categories as shown in figure\todo{ref this}.
    
    An other issue is the fact that the detector is still missing out on quite a few very promissing detections as demonstrated in \autoref{fig:detection_special_nodetect} or 


    - this brute force approach is dependent on the amount of data available (rare species means less data)


    new data generated info to discuss:
    It is worth noting that in future use cases, the sequence length will likely be more standardized.
    The actual length will depend on the camera settings -- common settings such as 1, 3, 5, or 10 images per trigger -- which can be extracted from the EXIF information of the images.

    Data augmentation a well established way to improve model's generalization \autocite{shortenSurveyImageData2019} was implemented and considered as an option but not actually used in the end.
