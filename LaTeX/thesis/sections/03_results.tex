\section{Results}
\label{results}

    \subsection{Detection}

    - after detection how many sequences are excluded

    - how many images are left per label

    \subsection{Classification Performance}

    All classification models performed well on their respective test sets.
    The balanced accuracy scores for each model are presented in \autoref{tab:bal_acc_by_model}.
    Pretrained models consistently outperformed those trained from scratch, as shown in \autoref{fig:bal_acc_img} for the image level scores.
    Generally, smaller models achieved slightly higher scores than larger ones, although these differences remained within one standard deviation.
    In particular, the pretrained EfficientNet-B0 reached the highest balanced accuracy of \(0.992\pm0.004\).
    Applying sequence-level classification to the image-level predictions improved balanced accuracy for every model, but only by \(0.001\) to \(0.005\), which again falls within a single standard deviation.
