\section{Results}
\label{results}

    \subsection{Detection}

    - after detection how many sequences are excluded

    - how many images are left per label

    \subsection{Classification Performance}

    - Table with all the models and their performance (Balanced Accuracy for the image and sequence level)

    - what models still to test? Does it make sense to do the not pretrained versions?

    \subsection{Best Model}

    - More information on the best model including CM
