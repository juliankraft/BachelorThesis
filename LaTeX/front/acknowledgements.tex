I am deeply grateful to my supervisor, Dr. Stefan Gl√ºge, for his invaluable guidance and engaging discussions throughout this thesis.
Besides his expertise in the field, he was exceptionally supportive and understanding --- his light-hearted approach and optimism were a great motivator for me.
Additional thanks go to Dr. Matthias Nyfeler, who provided the topic and ensured I had all the support needed throughout the project.  
I want to thank Prof. Dr. Roland Felix Graf and Nils Ratnaweera for their help in obtaining the data and all the information I needed on the Wildlife@Campus project to get started with the thesis.
For his support in answering many of my questions and proofreading my thesis, I am very grateful to my brother, Dr. Basil Kraft.
Finally, I would like to extend my thanks to the HPC support team for ensuring the smooth operation of the cluster and for their impressively swift responses to my questions.
